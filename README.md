# MidProject
## Introduction
* This Project is ECE387 Midterm Project. The chip I choose is ultrasonic range sensor. And I make a simply demo to demonstarte the function of Ultrasound rannge sensor. 
## Demo
* Using 3 Leds and one ultrasonic range sensor 
* If the distance between the sensor and object is less than 20 cm, the green LED will light up. If less than 10cm, the yellow Led will also loght up. And if less than 5 cm, three Leds will light up at the same time.
